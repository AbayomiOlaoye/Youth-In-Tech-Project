# Youth-In-Tech-Project
Here's my first capstone project, featuring a young and dynamic group of youngsters in tech. The project was inspired by my crave to see young minds being inspired by their colleagues who have seized the opportunity to learn the language of the future - not only for the security it affords but the feeling of accomplishment it bestows. I really hope to see my fellow country young men dare and dive into this atmosphere of CHANGE for a better World.

It was built with dynamism at it's very core: speakers' info were generated dynamically to save users time and reduced consumption of device's resources.This potentially reduce the lead time between sending _<code>http request</code>_ to and reception of _<code>http response</code>_ from the server.
